    """Default registration backend class

    A registration backend which floows a simple workflow:

    1.  User sigs up, inactive account with unusable password is created.

    2.  Inspector accept or reject the account registration.

    3.  Email is sent to user with/without activation link (without when
        rejected)

    4.  User clicks activation link, enter password, account is now active

    Using this backend requires that

    *   ``registration`` be listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings
        (since this backend makes use of models defined in this application).

    *   ``django.contrib.admin`` be listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings

    *   The setting ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS`` be supplied, specifying (as an
        integer) the number of days from acceptance during which a user may
        activate their account (after that period expires, activation will be
        disallowed). Default is ``7``

    *   The creation of the templates

        -   ``registration/registration_email.txt``
        -   ``registration/registration_email_subject.txt``
        -   ``registration/acceptance_email.txt``
        -   ``registration/acceptance_email_subject.txt``
        -   ``registration/rejection_email.txt``
        -   ``registration/rejection_email_subject.txt``
        -   ``registration/activation_email.txt``
        -   ``registration/activation_email_subject.txt``

    Additinally, registration can be temporarily closed by adding the setting
    ``REGISTRATION_OPEN`` and setting it to ``False``. Omitting this setting,
    or setting it to ``True``, will be imterpreted as meaning that registration
    is currently open and permitted.

    Internally, this is accomplished via storing an activation key in an
    instance of ``registration.models.RegistrationProfile``. See that model and
    its custom manager for full documentation of its fields and supported
    operations.
