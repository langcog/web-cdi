"""
Automatically log activated user in when they have activated with their activation
link. This doesn't happen when the user was activated programatically with Django
Admin site.

It is originally written by 'bluejeansummer' in 
https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/pull-request/5/optional-auto-login

To disable temporarily this feature, set ``False`` to ``REGISTRATION_AUTO_LOGIN``
of your ``settings.py``

.. Note::
    This feature is not available in tests because default tests of 
    django-inspectional-registration are not assumed to test with contributes.

    If you do want this feature to be available in tests, set
    ``_REGISTRATION_AUTO_LOGIN_IN_TESTS`` to ``True`` in ``setUp()`` method
    of the test case class and delete the attribute in ``tearDown()`` method.
